# #💻 Not A Mouse

```tabs
tab: ⚙️
because humans were contacted by the yd in the early 1800s and never really developed their own computers the normal way, human technology is a mishmash of a bunch of things from various alternate versions of humanity and as such the mouse never came to be the dominant method of controlling a cursor, and instead it merely shares the spotlight with methods such as trackballs, styluses, 360 degree joysticks, and motion detectors, each of which is the dominant control method in at least one instance of humanity across the universe.
