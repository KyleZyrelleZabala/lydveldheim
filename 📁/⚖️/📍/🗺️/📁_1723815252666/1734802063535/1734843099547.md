# #🔊 Voice-Controlled Plug-n-Play

because the atoline cant see and can only hear a muddled version of light, almost no atoline computer has a visual display. in fact, most atoline computers have no kind of display because most atoline have ascended beyond mortal forms and become one with their technology. the atoline who havent, meanwhile, use computers that are like when you call a number and the automated voice says shit like "press 1 to blah blah blah", except obviously its far less linear and involves more user participation at some points. some computers use buttons while others are purely voice controlled, while others just plug directly into the brain.
