	- instead of direct merge to make matches for table rows,
	- duplicate tables

				- rename to master_development and sub_loc_1
			- add column Source = "DLD"
		- property_monitor
			- remove other columns except master_development and sub_loc_1
			- add column Source = "PM"
	- append as new, area
		- create Merged column (master_development, sub_loc_1)

	- create community requirement table
		- map with area
- idea for daily note
