# #🗺️ Dimension

Dimensions are colloquially discussed in a spatial context: length, width, and height. The word shall be reframed for Ciel cosmology to make sense, as a more abstract property of a formless object. These abstract properties then give objects form.

A dimension will now be strictly referred to as an independent variable with singular degree of freedom. Properties on the other hand can either be an intrinsic or emergent trait of one or more dimensions that may or may not relate it to others.

Note that only the meaning is reframed. Points, lines, planes, shapes, and all the likes can still apply for easier visualization. Higher-order topologies can also be given approximate analogs.
