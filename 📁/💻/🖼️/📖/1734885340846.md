# #📝 WALL-E

At the rate we’re growing, we’re like a cancer to our own planet. Multiplying in population uncontrollably, using up natural resources rapidly, spreading everywhere we can, turning grasslands and forests and deserts into concrete cities or mountains of plastic waste. At the rate we’re growing, our planet cannot sustain us, and we might have to leave it for good before it decides to fight back relentlessly and kill us in the process. And that’s exactly what lead the people of Eden to live in a space ship and leave our immortal robot servants to clean up our toxic mess, hoping we’d be welcomed by the original Eden once again.

The movie Wall-E is a perfect depiction of a highly unrealistic environmental safety and management project, exaggerated and decorated into fictional proportions. The animated movie is set in a place and time wherein there is not enough space for too many humans and human waste so robots, called Wall-E’s, are designed and deployed to compress hills of garbage into walls of cubed trash. Earth atmosphere became toxic, and all but the hardiest species are extinct.

It’s about right: use garbage to clean up garbage while the perfect people get all lazy and fat without having to worry about garbage, or sickness, or any necessary effort. In a way, the project was a success. With walls of trash built by a lone surviving Wall-E, the world was once again clean enough for a single seedling to sprout. After several hundred years, it’s time to come home.

Overall, good story, good animation, good dialogue, good character development, good ending, but the real issues are hidden between the scenes. In fact, the problem is very real. The waste management systems we have now won’t hold forever and we have to think of an alternative, fast, lest we are evicted again from Eden. Hint: it’s not the Wall-E’s. Watching Wall-E’s work and fail made me think: we need something that can work faster, something that will not contribute to the problem itself. Something that’s right under our noses, but we have not the creativity to use.

If we ever had the time to just look it up and support it, there’s already plastic-eating bacteria accidentally evolved in laboratories while metal-eating microbes are just found lying in pockets of dirt under toxic lakes. There’s artificial photosynthesis carried out by artificial leaves and recyclable, even edible materials, less toxic than plastic. Nature already has the solution. But only if we let our technology implement it, and our political and economic structures support it, we don’t have to be the death of our own planet.
