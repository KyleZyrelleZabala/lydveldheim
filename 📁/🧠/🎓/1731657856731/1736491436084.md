## Life Cycle #‚öîÔ∏è Analysis Process

```
Data life cycle is composed of the stages in which data analysis takes place. While the life cycle and the analysis process differ in the specifics, some stages of the former coincide with the latter. Data life cycle details what to do with the data itself while data analysis process elaborates what to do with the data to make decisions.
