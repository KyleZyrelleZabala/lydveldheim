# #📖 Despair Axioms

```tabs
tab: 📄
Within half a decade, the Dreamwalkers managed to attain a sense of civilization along with the new species that inherited the Earth, but at costs too high to even look back upon. Better yet, our charming support group plans to go to the moon to get treatments after finding out that humans survived the apocalypse. 

However, the Earth is going to be dismantled by the descendants of humanity who evolved on worlds so different from ours they're no longer human. Worse, though, our own greatest grandchildren terraformed the whole solar system into a paradise, but torn by a two-pronged war between sentient solar flares and silicon lifeforms from Andromeda. The war has been going on for the better part of half a billion years, and the Earthlings are bound to get caught up in it.

Meanwhile, someone from the group went on an unintended journey in another place at another time, only to uncover daring truths that could potentially stop the war.
