# #⌨️ Pincer Double Cursor

lzsthl civilization essentially grew alongside computers (albeit primitive ones for most of their history) because they domesticated a species that they slowly selectively bred into biological computers (and then eventually augmented with technology when they were advanced enough). as such, they had simple computers by the time they were contacted by the yd, and their primary method of controlling a "cursor" is through joysticks, as its hard to biologically grow something like a mouse or trackball. as a result of lzsthl brains being split into various semi-independent sections, they are able to control two cursors at once (their version of cursor is more accurately translated as "pincer"). each pincer is controlled by a different joystick, and to do something like highlighting text, instead of clicking on one end and dragging the mouse they would instead put a pincer at each end of the text that they want to highlight and then press the highlight button (this is about as fast as clicking and dragging would be for a human). lzsthl computers are typically grown on the ceiling of a building, with a dome like indent that the lzsthl climbs onto a platform to get into (their homeworld has low gravity so reaching a ceiling isnt all that hard), and then they use the fleshy/mechanical outgrowths of the dome for the keyboard and joysticks, with the computer rapidly changing flesh colors to provide a 360 monitor (lzsthl eyes wrap around the entire "head"). lzsthl see in infrared and radiowaves so to a human itd just look black or white or something
