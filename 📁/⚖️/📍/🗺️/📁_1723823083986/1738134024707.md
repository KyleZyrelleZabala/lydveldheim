# #🔤 Time is a Trickster

People keep saying that time is an illusion... especially when its passing gets too real. That it heals all wounds, even if it causes most of them too. That it waits for no man. Heh. It's almost comedic. 

Funny. For us demigods of despair, time is a joke. A running, sickening gag.
