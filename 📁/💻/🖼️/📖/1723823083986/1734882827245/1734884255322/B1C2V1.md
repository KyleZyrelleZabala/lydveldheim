"Sshhh. I got it!"

The Writer quietly watches the water. A school is swiftly swimming past him. He, the Astronaut, and Illenia are on river duty today. 

"Keep dreaming, nerd."

A decade living a mile from the shore and he never tried fishing. His newfound friends are teasing him for it.

"Hah! Another one and we're done."

After two hours of freediving, the Astronaut burst out of the flowing water with glee - and with a large prey impaled on a makeshift spear. She tosses the catch to the baskets guarded by Illenia. The Astronaut's augmented muscles disturbing the river currents, driving away the school being watched intently by the Writer.

"Aw c'mon! You scared them away."

He slumps into the riverbed, defeated. 

"Sorry, champ. You'll get one someday!"

His rival taunts him further, chuckling with an endearing splash of water to his face.

"Ha ha."

Annoyed, he tried to reciprocate her endearment. However, by the dumbest stroke of luck, the dumbest mutant milkfish blitzed right into the cupped water he's about to throw into her face.

"Haha! Looks like someday means today."
