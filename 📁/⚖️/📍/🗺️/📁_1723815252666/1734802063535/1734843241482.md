# #🧠 Memory-DNA Bacterial Holovector

the imikti used vector displays instead of using pixels when using monitors, though holograms are quickly replacing them with how rapidly the imikti advance technologically, except at the same time holograms are quickly being replaced by the imikti becoming cyborgs (imikti "dna" and "memory" are one in the same and they constantly soak up information, going through a metamorphosis every couple months which goops them and puts them back together using the new memory-dna, essentially meaning a single imikti goes through thousands of generations of evolution in one lifetime, so they spent billions of years as microscopic organisms copying one another and getting nowhere until one of them got lucky with a mutation and then they proceeded to go through their equivalent of the entire history of multicellular life in just a thousand years and now shit's exponentially speeding up)
