# #📝 An Inconvenient Truth

Al Gore’s efforts on spreading the inconvenient truth about global warming really is an eye-opening, heart-warming documentary film. He effectively presented the evidence as well as the foreseeable effects of our increasing population and carbon emissions that correlate with the exponential rise of temperature in the past 10 or so years. However, on his quest of spreading the alarming news, he still encountered some very powerful resistance from scientists and research groups to government officials actively confusing the masses about the truth behind global warming.

The analogy of humanity having the same physiological response as a frog’s temperature adjustment mechanism, put my opinions into his perspective. I believe that we are led to believe that global warming is a slow, gradual phenomenon that will be solved soon. The problem is that everybody else believes it, too. Thus, no one is actually trying to solve the climate crisis, even though the disasters are accurately portrayed at unfathomable magnitudes, even though we already have the tools and technology to equally powerful to prevent such disasters. 

One thing I do not totally agree with Al Gore is that the political will is the lacking resource, though it certainly contributes to the problem.  In my opinion, we lack the appropriate market for the correct environmental management methods. Using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, ocean, and nuclear power are still magnitudes more expensive, if not more dangerous to build, than oil rigs and fossil fuel cells. Moreover, factories that produce today’s devices still use the traditional fossil and oil power with the highest carbon footprint, but even these are rapidly depleting.

Watching this documentary film made me think of Elon Musk and Tesla. He has the most morally correct idea among all businessmen. When cars only require electricity to function, they will become not only cheaper, but produce less carbon dioxide, and that effect will reverberate all throughout the economy, forcing simultaneously the peoples and the governments to accept and acclimate to the newest trend of renewables.
