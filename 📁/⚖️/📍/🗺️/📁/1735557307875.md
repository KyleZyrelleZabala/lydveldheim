# #⌨️ Binary Satisfiability Solver

```tabs
tab: 📄
- algorithm itself has many solutions
- output can be narrowed down by using input as constraints and vice versa
	- this Algorithmic Inversion is powerful
- current SAT solvers are not powerful enough to reduce prime number factoring
- better to think of it as inverting functions, 
	- since circuits can't really be run backwards
	- but they can be simulated in SAT solvers
