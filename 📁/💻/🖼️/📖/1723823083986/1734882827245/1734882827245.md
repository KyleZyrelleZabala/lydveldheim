# #📖 Dreamwalkers Anonymous

```tabs
tab: 📄
About 700 million years after humanity went extinct, a couple people short of two dozen survivors dreaming deep in cryosleep suddenly crashlanded back onto their estranged homeworld. Thing is, these people used to be millionaires, billionaires, - trillionaires even - terminally ill assholes, lucky bastards rich enough to mindlessly wait out the countless apocalypses that happened while they lie half-alive and half-dead waiting for a cure. 

Amidst the toxic air, the lack of trust, the reluctance to cooperate, and the tribes of savages looking to score a taste of their ancient meat, the irony persists: the worst examples of humanity have been given the grandest moral responsibility of determining the fate of their species.

Whether this will be the end or a new beginning, is up to the Dreamwalkers and their questionable camaraderie.
