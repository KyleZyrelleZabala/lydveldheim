# NP
- Verifiable in polynomial time
- Satisfiability problem itself is NP
	- hardest problem in NP
# NP-Complete
- It is in NP
- every problem in NP is reducible to it in polynomial time (NP-Hard)
- [[1735692955780|Stephen Cook]]
- [[1735693074524|Leonid Levin]] → [[1735693125136|Richard Karp]] lots of other problems can be translated into SAT
# General Reduction
- & if a solution for any one NP-Complete problems is found, then it can solve all other NP-Complete problems
- ? is there a polynomial time solution for SAT
# Verifiability
- ? If we can verify a potential solution quickly, we can solve the problem just as fast?
- $F \implies F^{-1}$
# Hash Function
- functions that are easy to compute, hard to "un-compute"
- ? is a negentropic function possible?
