# #📖 Deadpan Abdicants

tab: 📄
Fortunately, the war ended, but another - a bigger one took its place. Immortal post-human demigods claiming to have had a hand in all the chaos revealed their true forms and challenged the newly-forged truce. 

The Dreamwalkers rallied the vampire owlbats, the abandoned automata, the treesquid hivemind, the dolphin mermaids, the solar bugs, the manta crabs, the lettuce pixies, the dark angels, the snow krakens, and the flaying mantises altogether to convince the demigods that they're worth saving, all while fending off armed rebellions across two galaxies on an expedited collision course.

Futures are constantly being written and unwritten. It might even come to the point that there will be none at all. Even if it's against all the odds that the cosmos itself can offer, all they can do is to try their best to survive.
