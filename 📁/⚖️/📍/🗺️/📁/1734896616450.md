# #🎛️ Penrose Quantum Error Correcting Tiling

- forming the basis of unwanted repetition allows one to have parts of a system known while revealing nothing about the whole - mirroring both the no-cloning theorem AND preserving the inherent uncertainty of collective quantum states
- Amman bars are a pseudo-repeatable tiling that can overlay a Penrose tiling, which can be used to create new rhombic tiling patterns from existing ones by iteratively scaling it with the golden ratio
- [[1733641430007|Peter Shor]]'s algorithm can tolerate individual qubit errors while having a procedure to correct errors [as they occur](https://www.quantamagazine.org/never-repeating-tiles-can-safeguard-quantum-information-20240223/)
