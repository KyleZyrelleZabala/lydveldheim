# #💻 3D Trapezoid Monitor

the flafse exist outside yd territory so they also developed computers on their own. casual computer use among flafse typically only involves one head using the computer, though flafse gamers often have dual-monitor dual-head set ups for enhanced gaming experiences. flafse monitors are typically larger than human monitors yet also lower resolution, due to the flafse having poorer eyesight than humans. since flafse see in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum their monitors probably look all black or all white or something like that to humans idk im not a scientist. their monitors are also trapezoid shaped due to their triangular eye configuration. while the first flafse computers used 2d desktop environments like human computers, that was hundreds of years ago and the flafse now use computers with a 3d environment, as they are rather spatially-oriented creatures and as such navigating tabs in three dimensions feels much more comfortable for them. flafse computers from back when they were at irl human levels of technology used a split keyboard where each half was for one hand at the end of the body they were using for the computer, and instead of a cursor they used their trunks like a stylus. in modern flafse computers, the front hands type on holographic keyboards while the trunk moves forward backward left and right through the desktop environment using motion detection, and the middle hands move upwards and downwards through the desktop environment using motion detection as well. modern computers also use holograms instead of monitors fairly often but monitors are still rather popular
